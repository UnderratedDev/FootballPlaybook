- Bugs :
    - Some shapes aren't selectable (I believe this is fixed) - Yudhvir
    - Grid is selected with ctrl - A, check for grid Line, can copy grid (Should not get here if cannot select)
    
- Cool ideas :
    - Make canvas resizable (Pretty difficult, May not have time) (No library supports this)
    - Add more shapes (Rectangle, Triangle added)(Arrows?? (Too much)) - Yudhvir
